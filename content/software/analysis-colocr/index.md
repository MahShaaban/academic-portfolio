summary: "Automate the co-localization analysis of fluorescence microscopy images. Selecting regions of interest, extract pixel intensities from the image channels and calculate different co-localization statistics. The methods implemented in this package are based on Dunn et al. (2011) <doi:10.1152/ajpcell.00462.2010>."
