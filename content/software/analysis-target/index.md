summary: "Implement the BETA algorithm for inferring direct target genes from DNA-binding and perturbation expression data Wang et al. (2013) <doi: 10.1038/nprot.2013.150>. Extend the algorithm to predict the combined function of two DNA-binding elements from comparable binding and expression data."
