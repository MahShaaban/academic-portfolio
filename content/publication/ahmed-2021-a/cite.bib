 abstract = {Differentiating 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes are a mixture of non-identical culture cells. It is vital to identify the cell types that respond to the induction stimulus to understand the pre-adipocyte potential and the mature adipocyte behavior. To test this hypothesis, we deconvoluted the gene expression profiles of the cell culture of MDI-induced 3T3-L1 cells. Then we estimated the fractions of the sub-populations and their changes in time. We characterized the sub-populations based on their specific expression profiles. Initial cell cultures comprised three distinct phenotypes. A small fraction of the starting cells responded to the induction and developed into mature adipocytes. Unresponsive cells were probably under structural constraints or were committed to differentiating into alternative phenotypes. Using the same population gene markers, similar proportions were found in induced human primary adipocyte cell cultures. The three sub-populations had diverse responses to treatment with various drugs and compounds. Only the response of the maturating sub-population resembled that estimated from the profiles of the mixture. We then showed that even at a low division rate, a small fraction of cells could increase its share in a dynamic two-populations model. Finally, we used a cell cycle expression index to validate that model. To sum, pre-adipocytes are a mixture of different cells of which a limited fraction become mature adipocytes.},
