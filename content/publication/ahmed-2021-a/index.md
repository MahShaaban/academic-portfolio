abstract: Differentiating 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes are a mixture of non-identical culture
  cells. It is vital to identify the cell types that respond to the induction stimulus
  to understand the pre-adipocyte potential and the mature adipocyte behavior. To
  test this hypothesis, we deconvoluted the gene expression profiles of the cell culture
  of MDI-induced 3T3-L1 cells. Then we estimated the fractions of the sub-populations
  and their changes in time. We characterized the sub-populations based on their specific
  expression profiles. Initial cell cultures comprised three distinct phenotypes.
  A small fraction of the starting cells responded to the induction and developed
  into mature adipocytes. Unresponsive cells were probably under structural constraints
  or were committed to differentiating into alternative phenotypes. Using the same
  population gene markers, similar proportions were found in induced human primary
  adipocyte cell cultures. The three sub-populations had diverse responses to treatment
  with various drugs and compounds. Only the response of the maturating sub-population
  resembled that estimated from the profiles of the mixture. We then showed that even
  at a low division rate, a small fraction of cells could increase its share in a
  dynamic two-populations model. Finally, we used a cell cycle expression index to
  validate that model. To sum, pre-adipocytes are a mixture of different cells of
  which a limited fraction become mature adipocytes.
