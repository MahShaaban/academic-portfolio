 abstract = {We previously showed that some adipogenic transcription factors such as CEBPB and PPARG directly and indirectly regulate autophagy gene expression in adipogenesis. The order and the effect of these events are undetermined. In this study, we modeled the gene expression, DNA-binding of transcriptional regulators, and histone modifications during adipocyte differentiation and evaluated the effect of the regulators on gene expression in terms of direction and magnitude. Then, we identified the overlap of the transcription factors and co-factors binding sites and targets. Finally, we built a chromatin states model based on the histone marks and studied their relation with the factors' binding. Adipogenic factors differentially regulated autophagy genes as part of the differentiation program. Co-regulators associated with specific transcription factors and preceded them to the regulatory regions. Transcription factors differed in the binding time and location, and their effect on expression was either localized or long-lasting. Adipogenic factors disproportionately targeted genes coding for autophagy-specific transcription factors. To sum, a hierarchical arrangement between adipogenic transcription factors and co-factors drives the regulation of autophagy during adipocyte differentiation.},
