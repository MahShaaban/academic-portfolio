abstract: We previously showed that some adipogenic transcription factors such as
  CEBPB and PPARG directly and indirectly regulate autophagy gene expression in adipogenesis.
  The order and the effect of these events are undetermined. In this study, we modeled
  the gene expression, DNA-binding of transcriptional regulators, and histone modifications
  during adipocyte differentiation and evaluated the effect of the regulators on gene
  expression in terms of direction and magnitude. Then, we identified the overlap
  of the transcription factors and co-factors binding sites and targets. Finally,
  we built a chromatin states model based on the histone marks and studied their relation
  with the factors' binding. Adipogenic factors differentially regulated autophagy
  genes as part of the differentiation program. Co-regulators associated with specific
  transcription factors and preceded them to the regulatory regions. Transcription
  factors differed in the binding time and location, and their effect on expression
  was either localized or long-lasting. Adipogenic factors disproportionately targeted
  genes coding for autophagy-specific transcription factors. To sum, a hierarchical
  arrangement between adipogenic transcription factors and co-factors drives the regulation
  of autophagy during adipocyte differentiation.
