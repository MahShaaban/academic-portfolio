 abstract = {One million females are diagnosed worldwide every year with breast cancer, and the mortality rate of these patients remains high. Several treatments, including surgery, are available for breast cancer. $β$‑Lapachone ($β$‑Lap), a natural quinone compound, has been developed for cancer treatment due to its strong cytotoxic effect through its action on NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1)‑dependent activity. However, the mechanism in regards to how $β$‑Lap induces cytotoxicity in breast cancer cells is still elusive. In the present study, we showed that $β$‑Lap induced apoptotic cell death via activation of protein kinase A (PKA) in NQO1‑overexpressing MDA‑MB‑231 human breast cancer cells. This PKA‑dependent cell death was observed solely in NQO1‑overexpressing 231 cells via the high production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Cell survival of antioxidant [N‑acetylcysteine (NAC)]‑treated NQO1‑overexpressing 231 cells was significantly recovered, and NQO1‑negative 231 cells did not respond to $β$‑Lap. Antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl2 and Bcl‑xL were decreased, while proapoptotic proteins, including cytochrome c, activation of caspase‑3, and cleavage of PARP were increased after $β$‑Lap treatment of NQO1‑overexpressing 231 cells. Furthermore, PKA activators, forskolin or dibutyryl‑cAMP, an analog of cAMP, aggravated the $β$‑Lap‑induced apoptotic cell death by decreasing antiapoptotic proteins and further activating proapoptotic proteins in NQO1‑positive 231 cells. Treatment with a PKA inhibiter, H89, significantly increased cell viability even in NQO1‑overexpressing cells treated with $β$‑Lap. These data showed that $β$‑Lap activated PKA via ROS accumulation, subsequently leading to apoptotic cell death in NQO1‑positive breast cancer cells.},
