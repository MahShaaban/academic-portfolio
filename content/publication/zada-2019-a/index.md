abstract: One million females are diagnosed worldwide every year with breast cancer,
  and the mortality rate of these patients remains high. Several treatments, including
  surgery, are available for breast cancer. $β$‑Lapachone ($β$‑Lap), a natural quinone
  compound, has been developed for cancer treatment due to its strong cytotoxic effect
  through its action on NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1)‑dependent activity.
  However, the mechanism in regards to how $β$‑Lap induces cytotoxicity in breast
  cancer cells is still elusive. In the present study, we showed that $β$‑Lap induced
  apoptotic cell death via activation of protein kinase A (PKA) in NQO1‑overexpressing
  MDA‑MB‑231 human breast cancer cells. This PKA‑dependent cell death was observed
  solely in NQO1‑overexpressing 231 cells via the high production of reactive oxygen
  species (ROS). Cell survival of antioxidant [N‑acetylcysteine (NAC)]‑treated NQO1‑overexpressing
  231 cells was significantly recovered, and NQO1‑negative 231 cells did not respond
  to $β$‑Lap. Antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl2 and Bcl‑xL were decreased, while
  proapoptotic proteins, including cytochrome c, activation of caspase‑3, and cleavage
  of PARP were increased after $β$‑Lap treatment of NQO1‑overexpressing 231 cells.
  Furthermore, PKA activators, forskolin or dibutyryl‑cAMP, an analog of cAMP, aggravated
  the $β$‑Lap‑induced apoptotic cell death by decreasing antiapoptotic proteins and
  further activating proapoptotic proteins in NQO1‑positive 231 cells. Treatment with
  a PKA inhibiter, H89, significantly increased cell viability even in NQO1‑overexpressing
  cells treated with $β$‑Lap. These data showed that $β$‑Lap activated PKA via ROS
  accumulation, subsequently leading to apoptotic cell death in NQO1‑positive breast
  cancer cells.
