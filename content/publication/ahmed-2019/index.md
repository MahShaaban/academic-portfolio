abstract: Background Transcription factors and microRNAs play a critical role in regulating
  the gene expression in normal physiology and pathological conditions. Many bioinformatics
  tools were built to predict and identify transcription factor and microRNA targets
  and their role in the development of diseases including cancers. The availability
  of public access high-throughput data allows researchers to make data-driven predictions.
  Implementation Here, we developed an R package called cRegulome to access, manage
  and visualize data from open source databases. The package provides a programmatic
  access to the regulome (transcription factor and microRNA) expression correlations
  with target genes of different cancer types. It obtains a local instance of Cistrome
  Cancer and miRCancerdb databases and provides classes and methods to query, interact
  with and visualize the correlation data. Availability cRegulome is available on
  the comprehensive R archive network (CRAN) and the source code is hosted on GitHub
  as part of the ROpenSci on-boarding collection, https://github.com/ropensci/cRegulome.
