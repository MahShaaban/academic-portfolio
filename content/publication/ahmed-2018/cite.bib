 abstract = {Â© 2018 The Author(s). Objectives: microRNAs regulate expression of target genes by specifically binding to their transcripts, subsequently leading to translational inhibition or mRNA degradation. Gene regulation by microRNAs has been implicated in a wide range of physiological and pathological conditions. Here, we leverage the use of public-access data and the available genomic annotations to pre-calculate the correlation of the expression of a large number of microRNAs with gene at the mRNA and protein level in the context of cancers. Results: Expression data of miRNAs, mRNAs and proteins in cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas along with TargetScan miRNAs-target annotations were used to calculate the expression correlations between miRNAs and features (mRNAs/proteins) in a number of cancer studies. We then packed the output of this analysis into a database and made it available through an interactive web application. The miRCancerdb is an easy-to-use database to investigate the microRNAs-dependent regulation of target genes involved in development of cancer.},
