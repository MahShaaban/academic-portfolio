abstract: 'Objectives: microRNAs regulate expression of target
  genes by specifically binding to their transcripts, subsequently leading to translational
  inhibition or mRNA degradation. Gene regulation by microRNAs has been implicated
  in a wide range of physiological and pathological conditions. Here, we leverage
  the use of public-access data and the available genomic annotations to pre-calculate
  the correlation of the expression of a large number of microRNAs with gene at the
  mRNA and protein level in the context of cancers. Results: Expression data of miRNAs,
  mRNAs and proteins in cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas along with TargetScan
  miRNAs-target annotations were used to calculate the expression correlations between
  miRNAs and features (mRNAs/proteins) in a number of cancer studies. We then packed
  the output of this analysis into a database and made it available through an interactive
  web application. The miRCancerdb is an easy-to-use database to investigate the microRNAs-dependent
  regulation of target genes involved in development of cancer.'
