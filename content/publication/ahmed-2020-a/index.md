abstract: The 3T3-L1 cell line is used as an adipocyte differentiation model for the
  analysis of genes specifically expressed during the differentiation course. This
  cell model has several applications in obesity and insulin resistance research.
  We built a data resource to model gene expression of differentiating and mature
  adipocytes in response to several drugs and gene manipulations. We surveyed the
  literature survey for microarray datasets of differentiating 3T3-L1 cell line sampled
  at one or more time points under genetic or pharmacological perturbations. Data
  and metadata were obtained from the gene expression omnibus. The metadata were manually
  curated using unified language across the studies. Probe intensities were mapped
  and collapsed to genes using a reproducible pipeline. Samples were classified into
  none, genetically or pharmacologically modified. In addition to the clean datasets,
  two aggregated sets were further homogenized for illustration purposes. The curated
  datasets are available as an R/Bioconductor experimental data package curatedAdipoArray.
  The package documents the source code of the data collection, curation and processing.
  Finally, we used a subset of the data to effectively remove batch effects and reproduce
  biological observations. Database URL https://bioconductor.org/packages/curatedAdipoArray.
