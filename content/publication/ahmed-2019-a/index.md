abstract: Autophagy is the cell self-eating mechanism to maintain cell homeostasis
  by removing damaged intracellular proteins or organelles. It has also been implicated
  in the development and differentiation of various cell types including the adipocyte.
  Several links between adipogenic transcription factors and key autophagy genes has
  been suggested. In this study, we tried to model the gene expression and their transcriptional
  regulation during the adipocyte differentiation using high-throughput sequencing
  datasets of the 3T3-L1 cell model. We applied the gene expression and co-expression
  analysis to all and the subset of autophagy genes to study the binding, and occupancy
  patterns of adipogenic factors, co-factors and histone modifications on key autophagy
  genes. We also analyzed the gene expression of key autophagy genes under different
  transcription factor knockdown adipocyte cells. We found that a significant percent
  of the variance in the autophagy gene expression is explained by the differentiation
  stage of the cell. Adipogenic master regulators, such as CEBPB and PPARG target
  key autophagy genes directly. In addition, the same factor may also control autophagy
  gene expression indirectly through autophagy transcription factors such as FOXO1,
  TFEB or XBP1. Finally, the binding of adipogenic factors is associated with certain
  patterns of co-factors binding that might modulate the functions. Some of the findings
  were further confirmed under the knockdown of the adipogenic factors in the differentiating
  adipocytes. In conclusion, autophagy genes are regulated as part of the transcriptional
  programs through adipogenic factors either directly or indirectly through autophagy
  transcription factors during adipogenesis.
