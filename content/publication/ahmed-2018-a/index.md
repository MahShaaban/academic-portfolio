abstract: Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) plays a critical role in many signaling
  pathways as a multi-functional adapter protein. In particular, the loss of RKIP's
  function in certain types of cancer cells results in epithelial to mesenchymal transition
  (EMT) and the promotion of cancer metastasis. In addition, RKIP inhibits autophagy
  by modulating LC3-lipidation and mTORC1. How the RKIP-dependent inhibition of autophagy
  is linked to EMT and cancer progression is still under investigation. In this study,
  we investigated the ways by which RKIP interacts with key gene products in EMT and
  autophagy during the progression of prostate cancer. We first identified the gene
  products of interest using the corresponding gene ontology terms. The weighted-gene
  co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was applied on a gene expression dataset
  from three groups of prostate tissues; benign prostate hyperplasia, primary and
  metastatic cancer. We found two modules of highly co-expressed genes, which were
  preserved in other independent datasets of prostate cancer tissues. RKIP showed
  potentially novel interactions with one EMT and seven autophagy gene products (TGFBR1;
  PIK3C3, PIK3CB, TBC1D25, TBC1D5, TOLLIP, WDR45 and WIPI1). In addition, we identified
  several upstream transcription modulators that could regulate the expression of
  these gene products. Finally, we verified some RKIP novel interactions by co-localization
  using the confocal microscopy analysis in a prostate cancer cell line. To summarize,
  RKIP interacts with EMT and autophagy as part of the same functional unit in developing
  prostate cancer.
