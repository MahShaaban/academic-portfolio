abstract: Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP), also known as a phosphatidylethanolamine-binding
  protein 1 (PEBP1), functions as a tumor suppressor and regulates several signaling
  pathways, including ERK and NF-$Ä…ppa$B. RKIP is severely downregulated in human
  malignant cancers, indicating a functional association with cancer metastasis and
  poor prognosis. The transcription regulation of RKIP gene in human cancers is not
  well understood. In this study, we suggested a possible transcription mechanism
  for the regulation of RKIP in human cancer cells. We found that Metadherin (MTDH)
  significantly repressed the transcriptional activity of RKIP gene. An analysis of
  publicly available datasets showed that the knockdown of MTDH in breast and endometrial
  cancer cell lines induced the expression RKIP. In addition, the results obtained
  from qRT-PCR and ChIP analyses showed that MTDH considerably inhibited RKIP expression.
  In addition, the RKIP transcript levels in MTDH-knockdown or MTDH-overexpressing
  MCF-7 cells were likely correlated to the protein levels, suggesting that MTDH regulates
  RKIP expression. In conclusion, we suggest that MTDH is a novel factor that controls
  the RKIP transcription, which is essential for cancer progression.
