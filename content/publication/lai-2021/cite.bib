 abstract = {Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP), also known as a phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 1 (PEBP1), functions as a tumor suppressor and regulates several signaling pathways, including ERK and NF-$Ä…ppa$B. RKIP is severely downregulated in human malignant cancers, indicating a functional association with cancer metastasis and poor prognosis. The transcription regulation of RKIP gene in human cancers is not well understood. In this study, we suggested a possible transcription mechanism for the regulation of RKIP in human cancer cells. We found that Metadherin (MTDH) significantly repressed the transcriptional activity of RKIP gene. An analysis of publicly available datasets showed that the knockdown of MTDH in breast and endometrial cancer cell lines induced the expression RKIP. In addition, the results obtained from qRT-PCR and ChIP analyses showed that MTDH considerably inhibited RKIP expression. In addition, the RKIP transcript levels in MTDH-knockdown or MTDH-overexpressing MCF-7 cells were likely correlated to the protein levels, suggesting that MTDH regulates RKIP expression. In conclusion, we suggest that MTDH is a novel factor that controls the RKIP transcription, which is essential for cancer progression.},
