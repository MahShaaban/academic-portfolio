abstract: Autophagy is involved in the development and differentiation of many cell
  types. It is essential for the pre-adipocytes to respond to the differentiation
  stimuli and may contribute to reorganizing the intracellulum to adapt the morphological
  and metabolic demands. Although AMPK, an energy sensor, has been associated with
  autophagy in several cellular processes, how it connects to autophagy during the
  adipocyte differentiation remains to be investigated. Here, we studied the interaction
  between AMPK and autophagy gene products at the mRNA level during adipocyte differentiation
  using public-access datasets. We used the weighted-gene co-expression analysis to
  detect and validate multiple interconnected modules of co-expressed genes in a dataset
  of MDI-induced 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes. These modules were found to be highly correlated
  with the differentiation course of the adipocytes. Several novel interactions between
  AMPK and autophagy gene products were identified. Together, it is possible that
  AMPK-autophagy interaction is temporally and locally modulated in response to the
  differentiation stimuli.
