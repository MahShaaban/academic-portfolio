 abstract = {Autophagy is involved in the development and differentiation of many cell types. It is essential for the pre-adipocytes to respond to the differentiation stimuli and may contribute to reorganizing the intracellulum to adapt the morphological and metabolic demands. Although AMPK, an energy sensor, has been associated with autophagy in several cellular processes, how it connects to autophagy during the adipocyte differentiation remains to be investigated. Here, we studied the interaction between AMPK and autophagy gene products at the mRNA level during adipocyte differentiation using public-access datasets. We used the weighted-gene co-expression analysis to detect and validate multiple interconnected modules of co-expressed genes in a dataset of MDI-induced 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes. These modules were found to be highly correlated with the differentiation course of the adipocytes. Several novel interactions between AMPK and autophagy gene products were identified. Together, it is possible that AMPK-autophagy interaction is temporally and locally modulated in response to the differentiation stimuli.},
