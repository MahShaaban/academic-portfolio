abstract: Autophagy contributes to reorganizing intracellular components and forming
  fat droplets during the adipocyte differentiation. Here, we systematically describe
  the role of autophagy-related genes and gene sets during the differentiation of
  adipocytes. We used a public dataset from the European Nucleotide Archive from an
  RNA-seq experiment in which 3T3-L1 cells were induced by a differentiation induction
  medium, total RNA was extracted and sequenced at four different time points. Raw
  reads were aligned to the UCSC mouse reference genome (mm10) using HISAT2, and aligned
  reads were summarized at the gene or exon level using HTSeq. DESeq2 and DEXSeq were
  used to model the gene and exon counts and test for differential expression and
  relative exon usage, respectively. After applying the appropriate transformation,
  gene counts were used to perform the gene set and pathway enrichment analysis. Data
  were obtained, processed and annotated using R and Bioconductor. Several autophagy-related
  genes and autophagy gene sets, as defined in the Gene Ontology, were actively regulated
  during the course of the adipocyte differentiation. We further characterized these
  gene sets by clustering thei r members to a few distinct temporal profiles. Other
  potential functionally related genes were identified using a machine learning procedure.
  In summary, we characterized the autophagy gene sets and their members to biologically
  meaningful groups and elected a number of genes to be functionally related based
  on their expression patterns, suggesting that autophagy plays a critical role in
  removal of some intracellular components and supply of energy sources for lipid
  biogenesis during adipogenesis.
