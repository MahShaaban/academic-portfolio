abstract: Autophagy, an intracellular degradation process, is essential for maintaining
  cell homeostasis by removing damaged organelles and proteins under various conditions
  of stress. In cancer, autophagy has conflicting functions. It plays a key role in
  protecting against cancerous transformation by maintaining genomic stability against
  genotoxic components, leading to cancerous transformation. It can also promote cancer
  cell survival by supplying minimal amounts of nutrients during cancer progression.
  However, the molecular mechanisms underlying how autophagy regulates the epithelial-to-mesenchymal
  transition (EMT) and cancer metastasis are unknown. Here, we show that starvation-induced
  autophagy promotes Snail (SNAI1) degradation and inhibits EMT and metastasis in
  cancer cells. Interestingly, SNAI1 proteins were physically associated and colocalized
  with LC3 and SQSTM1 in cancer cells. We also found a significant decrease in the
  levels of EMT and metastatic proteins under starvation conditions. Furthermore,
  ATG7 knockdown inhibited autophagy-induced SNAI1 degradation in the cytoplasm, which
  was associated with a decrease in SNAI1 nuclear translocation. Moreover, cancer
  cell invasion and migration were significantly inhibited by starvation-induced autophagy.
  These findings suggest that autophagy-dependent SNAI1 degradation could specifically
  regulate EMT and cancer metastasis during tumorigenesis.
