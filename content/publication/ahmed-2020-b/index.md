abstract: Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP) is under extensive study for its anti-metastatic
  taking role, and it contributes to the regulation of several signaling pathways
  and physiological processes in cells. Indeed, the loss or low expression of RKIP
  in cancer tissues results in aggressive metastatic phenotypes. Besides, some studies
  suggest that RKIP negatively regulates autophagy, a catabolic pathway to supply
  energy for the survival of cancer cells under starvation conditions, giving a clue
  why disrupting RKIP signaling can promote metastasis. By contrast, autophagy prevents
  tumorigenesis by selectively removing damaged materials and intracellular organelles
  in normal and cancer cells. In this report, we briefly introduce the functional
  role of RKIP in cancer metastasis and its link to autophagy. Then, we summarize
  reports of the multiple direct and indirect RKIP-autophagy interactions. Linking
  RKIP to autophagy in cancer can help to better understand the cancer metastasis
  and suggests new therapeutic targets.
