 abstract = {Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP) is under extensive study for its anti-metastatic taking role, and it contributes to the regulation of several signaling pathways and physiological processes in cells. Indeed, the loss or low expression of RKIP in cancer tissues results in aggressive metastatic phenotypes. Besides, some studies suggest that RKIP negatively regulates autophagy, a catabolic pathway to supply energy for the survival of cancer cells under starvation conditions, giving a clue why disrupting RKIP signaling can promote metastasis. By contrast, autophagy prevents tumorigenesis by selectively removing damaged materials and intracellular organelles in normal and cancer cells. In this report, we briefly introduce the functional role of RKIP in cancer metastasis and its link to autophagy. Then, we summarize reports of the multiple direct and indirect RKIP-autophagy interactions. Linking RKIP to autophagy in cancer can help to better understand the cancer metastasis and suggests new therapeutic targets.},
