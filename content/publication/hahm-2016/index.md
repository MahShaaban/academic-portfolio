abstract: 3T3-L1 preadipocytes undergo adipogenesis in response to treatment with
  dexamethaxone, 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, and insulin (DMI) through activation
  of several adipogenic transcription factors. Many autophagy-related proteins are
  also highly activated in the earlier stages of adipogenesis, and the LC3 conjugation
  system is required for formation of lipid droplets. Here, we investigated the effect
  of overexpression of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-LC3 fusion protein on adipogenesis.
  Overexpression of GFP-LC3 in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes using poly-l-lysine-assisted adenoviral
  GFP-LC3 transduction was sufficient to produce intracellular lipid droplets. Indeed,
  GFP-LC3 overexpression stimulated expression of some adipogenic transcription factors
  (e.g., C/EBP$α$ or $β$, PPAR$γ$, SREBP2). In particular, SREBP2 was highly activated
  in preadipocytes transfected with adenoviral GFP-LC3. Also, phosphorylation of Raf
  kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP) at serine 153, consequently stimulating extracellular-signal
  regulated kinase (ERK)1 activity, was significantly increased during adipogenesis
  induced by either poly-l-lysine-assisted adenoviral GFP-LC3 transduction or culture
  in the presence of dexamethasone, 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, and insulin. Furthermore,
  RKIP knockdown promoted ERK1 and PPAR$γ$ activation, and significantly increased
  the intracellular accumulation of triacylglycerides in DMI-induced adipogenesis.
  In conclusion, GFP-LC3 overexpression in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes stimulates adipocyte
  differentiation via direct modulation of RKIP-dependent ERK1 activity.
