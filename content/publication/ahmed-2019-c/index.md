abstract: The 3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte cell line is widely used to study the fat cell
  differentiation in vitro. Researchers also use this cell model to study obesity
  and insulin resistance. We surveyed the literature, the gene expression omnibus
  and the sequence read archive for RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq datasets of MDI-induced 3T3-L1
  differentiating cells sampled at one or more time points. The metadata of the relevant
  datasets were manually curated using unified language across the original studies.
  The raw reads were collected and pre-processed using a reproducible state-of-the-art
  pipeline. The final datasets are presented as reads count in genes for the RNA-Seq
  and reads count in peaks for the ChIP-Seq dataset. The curated datasets are available
  as two Bioconductor experimental data packages curatedAdipoRNA and curatedAdipoChIP.
  In addition, the packages document the source code of the data collection and the
  pre-processing pipelines. Here, we provide a descriptive analysis of the datasets
  with context and technical validation.
