abstract: Researchers use ChIP binding data to identify potential transcription factor binding sites. They use gene expression data from sequencing or microarrays to quantify the effect of the factor over-expression or knockdown on its targets. The integration of the binding and expression data therefore can be used to improve the understanding of a transcription factor function. In this workshop, I present a complete workflow for integrating the gene expression (microarray/RNA-seq) and DNA-binding data (ChIP-seq) to predict the combined function of two transcription factors using R/Bioconductor. The example we will be using in the workshop is from real datasets of two functionally and evolutionary-related transcription factors YY1 and YY2 in HeLa cells. We will try to identify the factor-specific and the shared targets of the factors in this particular cell line. Then we will use a technique to find out the aggregate functions of the factors on their individual (inducer or repressor) and common targets (cooperative or competitive).
