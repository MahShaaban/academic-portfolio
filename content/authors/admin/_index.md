I graduated from Cairo University in Egypt with a bachelor's in medicine and surgery. For a year after graduation, I traveled to different countries working and volunteering with youth organizations. I took part in running cultural and outdoor activities directed at youth and young adults. Since I joined the Graduate School of Gyeongsang National University in South Korea. Here, I got my Master of Science and am currently in my final year toward a Ph.D. My research focuses on the role of Autophagy in development and disease.

As an undergraduate, I studied basic medical sciences and did clinical rotations in internal medicine and surgery. Both helped me understand normal body functions and what could go wrong with it. In my current research, I try to understand basic cellular mechanisms and to connect this knowledge to health and disease.

Much like working with international staff for youth organizations, my current department houses researchers and staff from different countries and backgrounds. This, in addition to involving in open source and open science communities, make me aspire to incorporating diverse ideas in the work I do in my current and future positions.
